# Luke Benwell – Technical Architect

## About Me
I’m a Technical Architect with over 6 years of professional IT experience, having progressed from 1st Line Support through 2nd and 3rd Line engineering into architecture-focused roles. This hands-on experience gives me a practical understanding of how systems operate, which informs my approach to designing solutions that are not only technically sound but also supportable and aligned with business needs.

I specialise in designing and delivering **secure, scalable, and resilient architectures** across both cloud and on-premises environments. My expertise spans **Windows Server, Active Directory, Group Policy, and identity and access management**, as well as **cloud platforms including Azure, AWS, and virtualization with Proxmox**. I leverage **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)** and automation to ensure consistency, reliability, and efficiency in deployments, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.

I enjoy translating complex business requirements into **clear, well-documented technical designs** and architecture decision records, balancing operational needs, scalability, and security. My approach is always focused on creating IT ecosystems that are resilient, maintainable, and capable of supporting business growth — from hybrid cloud migrations and modern device management to secure network and cloud solutions.

## Core Skills
**Windows Server

Design, deployment, and administration of multi-domain Windows Server environments.

Management of Active Directory, Group Policy, DNS, DHCP, and other core services.

Implementation of high-availability configurations, clustering, and failover strategies.

Performance monitoring, patching, and operational troubleshooting.

Migration and upgrade planning across server versions with minimal downtime.

**Active Directory & Identity Management

Architecture and management of AD forests, domains, trusts, and OU structures.

Implementation of identity lifecycle management, including onboarding/offboarding automation.

Design and deployment of hybrid Azure AD environments, Intune, and Endpoint Manager for modern device management and compliance.

Group Policy and security baseline configuration, ensuring consistent user and system policies.

Integration with cloud IAM and Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions to unify identity management.

**Cybersecurity

Patch & Vulnerability Management – Regular assessment, prioritisation, and remediation of vulnerabilities using tools such as ManageEngine, OS-native tools, and cloud security dashboards.

Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) – Aligning IT infrastructure with frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, and organisational security policies.

Threat Classification & Analysis – Identification, classification, and prioritisation of potential security threats to systems and data.

Vulnerability Remediation & Hardening – Applying secure baselines, remediating vulnerabilities, and hardening servers, endpoints, and applications.

Incident Response & Monitoring – Setting up alerts, monitoring logs, and executing response plans to contain and resolve security events.

Cloud & Hybrid Security – Implementing IAM, network segmentation, encryption, and zero-trust controls in Azure, AWS, and hybrid environments.

**Cloud & Virtualisation

Design and deployment of scalable cloud solutions on Azure and AWS.

Management of hybrid and multi-cloud environments with secure connectivity.

Virtualisation using Proxmox, VMware, and Hyper-V, including high-availability and resource optimisation.

Implementation of Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep, Ansible) to automate provisioning, configuration, and ongoing management.

Cloud cost optimisation, performance monitoring, and resilience planning.

**Networking & Security Design

Architecture of secure network topologies, including segmentation, VLANs, VPNs, firewalls, and routing.

Implementation of Zero Trust principles and least-privilege access across networks and systems.

Design of network redundancy, load balancing, and failover for high-availability environments.

Security monitoring, logging, and intrusion detection using native and third-party tools.

Collaboration with security teams to ensure alignment with organisational policies and compliance requirements.

**Infrastructure as Code & Automation

Automating deployment, configuration, and management using Terraform, Ansible, and PowerShell.

Scripting operational tasks, patching, and account management to reduce manual errors.

Standardising environments to ensure reproducibility, consistency, and auditability.

Integrating automation into CI/CD pipelines for faster, reliable releases.

Driving efficiency and consistency across multi-environment deployments.

**Monitoring, Backup, & Disaster Recovery

Designing monitoring and observability systems to track performance, availability, and security metrics.

Implementing backup and recovery solutions to meet RTO and RPO requirements.

Planning disaster recovery and high-availability strategies for both on-premises and cloud environments.

Continuous testing and validation of recovery processes to ensure business continuity.

**Stakeholder Communication & Documentation

Translating complex technical designs into clear, understandable documentation for business and technical audiences.

Producing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), runbooks, and technical guides to support long-term maintainability.

Leading workshops, knowledge sharing sessions, and technical reviews with cross-functional teams.

Collaborating with clients and business leaders to align technical solutions with organisational goals.
