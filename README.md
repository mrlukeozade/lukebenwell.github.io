# Luke Benwell – Technical Architect

---

## About Me
I’m a Technical Architect with over **6 years of professional IT experience**, having progressed from 1st Line Support through 2nd and 3rd Line engineering into architecture-focused roles. This hands-on background gives me a practical understanding of how systems operate, which informs my approach to designing solutions that are **technically sound, secure, and aligned with business needs**.

I specialise in designing and delivering **secure, scalable, and resilient architectures** across both **cloud and on-premises environments**, with a strong focus on **identity, security, automation, and Infrastructure as Code**. I enjoy translating complex business requirements into **clear, well-documented technical designs** and architecture decision records, balancing operational needs, scalability, and security.
