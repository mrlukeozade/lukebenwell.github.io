# Luke Benwell – Technical Architect

## About Me
I’m a Technical Architect with over 6 years of professional IT experience, having progressed from 1st Line Support through 2nd and 3rd Line engineering into architecture-focused roles. This hands-on experience gives me a practical understanding of how systems operate, which informs my approach to designing solutions that are not only technically sound but also supportable and aligned with business needs.

I specialise in designing and delivering **secure, scalable, and resilient architectures** across both cloud and on-premises environments. My expertise spans **Windows Server, Active Directory, Group Policy, and identity and access management**, as well as **cloud platforms including Azure, AWS, and virtualization with Proxmox**. I leverage **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)** and automation to ensure consistency, reliability, and efficiency in deployments, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.

I enjoy translating complex business requirements into **clear, well-documented technical designs** and architecture decision records, balancing operational needs, scalability, and security. My approach is always focused on creating IT ecosystems that are resilient, maintainable, and capable of supporting business growth — from hybrid cloud migrations and modern device management to secure network and cloud solutions.
